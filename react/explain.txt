How create a react application ?

        images
        robots.txt

How is works ?
    ==> main entry of react app is index.js

    ==> RDOM ==> root html page ==> html

    ==> index ==> App.js ==> All project\
    ==> index.js => entry file

    ==> App.js ==> component

What are component ?
    # component are basic building block of application


    App.js
        Navigation
            Nav
        MainSection
            Section
            Header
        Footer
            Footer

    # component
        function (max)
        class

        We write a html like code called as JSX
        JSX => Javascript XML

        Rules JSX
            in return it must have only one parent
            <> ==> JSX fragment
            {} ==> JSX expression (write js code)
